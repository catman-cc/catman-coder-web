CatMan Workbench is a distributed application, which means that it can be 
deployed on multiple servers to achieve high availability and load balancing. 
It is also designed to be highly scalable, 
so you can add more servers as your needs grow.

Cat Man Workbench provides a dynamic access mechanism. You can deploy 
working nodes locally or on any server and access central services.

Its built-in scheduling strategy and execution strategy are isolated from
resources. Users can isolate and share resources for various departments 
and even individuals in the same CatMan Workbench service according to
